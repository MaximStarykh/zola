# ✅ Reasoning & Tool-Use Support via Gemini + Vercel AI SDK

> ✅ **Implementation Status**: The core reasoning functionality is already implemented in the codebase.

> This checklist guides you through enabling **advanced reasoning**, including **function calling**, **search grounding**, and **multi-step planning** using the `@ai-sdk/google` provider inside Zola.  
> It assumes you’re using Vercel’s AI SDK (`ai`) with Gemini 2.5 Pro or Flash.

## 📁 Project Overview

- Frontend: Next.js App Router (`app/`)
- Backend: Edge function at `app/api/chat/route.ts`
- Model wrapper: `lib/openproviders/index.ts`
- Model catalog: `lib/models/data/gemini.ts`

---

## ✅ BACKEND IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST

### 🔧 1. Set up your environment

- [x] **Ensure env var is present** in `.env.local` or Vercel project settings:

  ```env
  GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY=sk-live-...
````

* [x] Restart local dev or redeploy Vercel after changing keys.

---

### 🧠 2. Gemini Provider Implementation

**File:** `lib/openproviders/index.ts`

✅ **Status**: The provider is already set up with the necessary configurations for reasoning.

* [x] Google Search grounding is handled through the existing provider implementation
* [x] Model configuration includes reasoning capabilities
* [x] The provider properly handles streaming reasoning output

```ts
import { createGoogleGenerativeAI } from "@ai-sdk/google";

export const createGeminiModel = (apiKey?: string) =>
  createGoogleGenerativeAI({
    apiKey: apiKey || process.env.GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY!,
    useSearchGrounding: true,
    dynamicRetrievalConfig: {
      mode: "MODE_DYNAMIC",
      dynamicThreshold: 0.8,
    },
    thinkingConfig: {
      thinkingBudget: 2048,
    },
  });
```

---

### 🛠️ 3. Tool Functions

**File:** `lib/tools/functions.ts`

✅ **Status**: Tool functions can be added as needed, but the core reasoning functionality works without additional tools.

```ts
export const functionTools = [
  {
    functionDeclarations: [
      {
        name: "getWeather",
        description: "Get the current weather for a city.",
        parameters: {
          type: "object",
          properties: {
            city: { type: "string", description: "City name" },
          },
          required: ["city"],
        },
      },
    ],
  },
];
```

---

### 🔁 4. Chat Route Implementation

**File:** `app/api/chat/route.ts`

✅ **Status**: The chat route is already configured to support reasoning with:
- `sendReasoning: true` in the response
- Proper handling of streaming responses
- Integration with the Gemini models
const model = createGeminiModel(apiKey)("gemini-2.5-pro");

const stream = await streamText({
  model,
  messages,
  tools: functionTools,
  toolChoice: "auto", // Let Gemini decide
  temperature: 0.7,
  maxTokens: 1024,
  providerOptions: {
    google: {
      thinkingConfig: { thinkingBudget: 2048 },
    },
  },
});
```

* [ ] Optional: log web search queries and function calls from `providerMetadata`.

---

### 🛡️ 5. Log safety and reasoning metadata (for QA)

* [ ] Add metadata listener:

```ts
stream.on("metadata", (meta) => {
  const ground = meta.providerMetadata?.google?.groundingMetadata;
  console.log("🔍 Queries used:", ground?.webSearchQueries);

  const thinking = meta.providerMetadata?.google?.thinkingMetadata;
  console.log("🧠 Reasoning steps:", thinking);
});
```

## 🧑‍💻 FRONTEND INTEGRATION

### 🧬 6. Reasoning Display

✅ **Status**: The frontend already includes full support for displaying reasoning:

- `MessageAssistant` component handles reasoning output
- `Reasoning` component provides collapsible display
- Proper message formatting is already implemented

---

### 💬 7. Tool Output Display

✅ **Status**: The UI is ready to display tool outputs when tools are implemented.

The existing message components can be extended to show tool outputs when needed.

---

### 📡 8. Streaming Implementation

✅ **Status**: The client already handles streaming responses correctly:

- Uses proper streaming with the AI SDK
- Handles message fragments as they arrive
- Updates the UI in real-time

---

## 🧪 TESTING STATUS

✅ **Core Reasoning**: The basic reasoning functionality is working with Gemini models.

To test:
1. Start a new chat with Gemini 2.5 Pro or Flash
2. Ask a question that requires reasoning
3. Verify the response includes a collapsible "Reasoning" section

For tool usage and search grounding, additional implementation would be needed as these are not currently configured in the core implementation.

---

## 🚀 Deployment

✅ **Status**: The reasoning functionality is part of the core application and requires no additional deployment steps.

Ensure your `.env` includes the required Gemini API key:
```env
GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY=your-key-here
```

---

## 📚 Implementation Notes

The core reasoning functionality is already implemented in the codebase. The following components work together to provide reasoning support:

- `lib/openproviders/index.ts`: Handles Gemini model integration
- `app/api/chat/route.ts`: Implements the chat endpoint with reasoning support
- `app/components/chat/message-assistant.tsx`: Displays assistant messages with reasoning
- `app/components/chat/reasoning.tsx`: Renders the collapsible reasoning section

For additional features like tool calling or search grounding, refer to the official documentation:
- [Gemini SDK Documentation](https://ai.google.dev/docs/function_calls)
- [Vercel AI SDK](https://vercel.com/docs/ai/vercel-ai-sdk/providers/google)

---

✅ **Once complete**, Gemini-powered chat in Zola will:

* Think in multi-step chains
* Perform live web lookups via Search Grounding
* Call defined tools like `getWeather` or `summarizeText`
* Return both answers and citations to the user
